\subsection{GNSSFixData Mode Indicator} \label{gns-extra}

This field contains multiple characters, each corresponding to different constellations:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item GPS (United States of America)
	\item GLONASS (Russia)
\end{enumerate}

The letters indicate the following: \\

\begin{tabular}{|l l|}
	N & No fix. Constellation is not used in fix or fix is bad \\
	A & Autonomous. Constellation is used in non-differential mode \\
	D & Constellation is used in differential mode \\
	P & Precise. Constellation is used in precision mode. \\
	R & Real Time Kinematic. Constellation is in RTK mode with fixed integers \\
	F & RTK with floating point numbers \\
	E & Estimated (dead reckoning) Mode \\
	M & Manual input mode \\
	S & Simulation \\
\end{tabular}
\\
